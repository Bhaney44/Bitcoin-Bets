# Bitcoin Bets
[Bitcoin Bets](https://www.decentralized-decisions.app/) is a betting application for the 2023 MIT Bitcoin Expo Hackathon. The goal for the project is to make betting with Bitcoin easy. Check out the demo on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZ3iodc9KM), to see how it works.

*Dedication.* Bitcoin Bets is dedicated to the late, great Bitcoiner Hal Finney. Read Finney's story in the Bitcoin Forum, [Bitcoin and Me (Hal Finney).](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155054.0)

# Problem
The technical challenge in Bitcoin betting lies in ensuring the security and reliability of the platform to ensure a fair and trustworthy experience for users. Bitcoin's decentralized nature presents unique technical challenges, such as ensuring the accuracy of transactions, preventing hacking attempts, and protecting user data privacy. Furthermore, the integration of Bitcoin into the betting process requires a high degree of technical proficiency to ensure the proper handling of funds and transactions. There is a need for a robust technical infrastructure that can handle the complexities of Bitcoin betting and provide a secure, reliable, and user-friendly platform for users. Addressing these technical challenges is critical to ensuring the success and growth of the Bitcoin betting industry.

# Solution
Our solution seeks to solve the Bitcoin betting problem using Algorand Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) as a scaling solution. The solution aims to address the current limitations of Bitcoin betting, such as high transaction fees, slow transaction times, and lack of privacy, by leveraging Algorand's capabilities in transaction speed, low fees, and ZKPs to ensure privacy and security. The dApp allows users to place bets on sporting events with Bitcoin with on-chain results, ensuring a fair and transparent betting environment. The solution aims to provide a fast, efficient, and secure betting platform for users while maintaining the integrity and privacy of their bets.
